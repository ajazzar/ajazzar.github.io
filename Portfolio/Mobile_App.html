            <p>I made this web page in my Mobile App class.I implemented a password-based entry page and a page to get basic information about the boiler such as the boiler ID, 
               date of purchase, maximum allowable values of pressure and temperature, and an ability to change the password. I created a page to allow the user to change the basic 
               information and a page to enter data — temperature and pressure.</p>
             <br><p>In this Game, the user is supposed to click on the UFOs to destroy them before they can land on Earth.</p>

             <br><p>Even though the course covered mobile design using jQuery UI, a framework called Bootstrap is used more widely in the industry to make responsive web pages.
               I used Bootstrap in order to display the nine Skywalker Saga Star Wars movies in this Site.</p>
